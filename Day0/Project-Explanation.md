✅ Project 1: CI/CD Pipeline for E-Commerce Web Application (React + Django)
Interview Explanation:

"In this project, I built and deployed a full-stack e-commerce application using React for the frontend and Django for the backend. The goal was to fully automate the CI/CD process and deploy the application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

I containerized both frontend and backend using Docker and used Azure DevOps pipelines for building, testing, and deploying these containers to AKS. I also integrated GitHub Actions to handle code linting, automated tests, and trigger deployments on code merges.

On the infrastructure side, I set up ingress controllers for routing, configured load balancing, and enabled auto-scaling on the AKS cluster. For observability, I used Azure Monitor and Log Analytics to track logs and performance metrics.

This project helped improve deployment speed, ensured code quality through automation, and made the application production-ready using cloud-native practices."

✅ Project 2: Internal Ticketing System for IT Support (React + Django REST)
Interview Explanation:

"This was an internal helpdesk ticketing system designed for IT support teams. I used React for the frontend and Django REST Framework for the backend API. We focused on modular, containerized development.

I created separate Docker containers for frontend and backend and set up Jenkins pipelines to automate the CI process—including unit tests and Docker image builds. The application was deployed to Azure Virtual Machines running Linux, using Nginx as the reverse proxy.

I implemented role-based access using JWT authentication in Django, so different users had different permissions. For basic monitoring and alerting, I used Azure VM Insights and shell scripts to track system health and performance.

This project improved internal ticket resolution workflows and helped me gain hands-on experience with Jenkins, Docker, and infrastructure-level deployments."
