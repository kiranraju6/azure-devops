azure devops self introduction

hi I am kiran, as a DevOps Engineer with 4 years of experience in managing and supporting Azure-based infrastructure and deployment pipelines. My expertise lies in Azure DevOps, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Monitor. I have worked extensively on support projects, ensuring high availability, performance optimization, and troubleshooting Azure-based workloads.

Throughout my career, I have been responsible for managing CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps, automating deployments, and optimizing cloud resources for better efficiency. I have hands-on experience with Azure Repos, Azure Pipelines, and ARM Templates, which have helped streamline the release process and infrastructure provisioning. I have also worked on monitoring and logging solutions using Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights, ensuring system reliability and proactive issue resolution.

In my role, I have provided L2/L3 support for Azure-based applications, handling incident management, root cause analysis (RCA), and performance tuning. I have collaborated with development and operations teams to resolve production issues, improve deployment strategies, and ensure zero-downtime deployments. Additionally, I have worked with Azure Networking (VNETs, Load Balancers, and Application Gateways) to manage secure and scalable cloud environments.

Apart from technical support, I have experience in automating repetitive tasks using PowerShell and Azure CLI, reducing manual intervention and improving operational efficiency. I have also worked on implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and security best practices to ensure compliance and governance in Azure environments.

I am passionate about learning and improving Azure DevOps processes, staying updated with the latest cloud trends, and continuously enhancing system performance. My goal is to optimize cloud infrastructure, enhance automation, and contribute to the seamless operation of Azure-based applications.
